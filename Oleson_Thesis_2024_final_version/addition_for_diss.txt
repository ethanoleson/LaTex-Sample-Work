The scalloped sample from Omega Cave exhibited an interesting pattern on the micron scale. 
Figure \ref{fig:microscallops} shows an ESEM image of 71923A and highlights a “scallop-like” 
pattern in the flow direction indicated by the larger scallop feature (not visible in the ESEM image). 
The pockets seem to correspond to the ooid locations, although some pockets are empty. 
These features are on the order of 100s of microns in width and length. The source of these features is not clear, 
and we hesitate to call these scallops as their dimensions are less than the characteristic length of features 
produced by the critical boundary layer thickness predicted by the rates from \cite{plummer} \citep{dreybrodtandbuhmann, 
covingtonletter}. However, their scale is similar to the DBL thickness indicated by the relation for rough pipes 
presented by \cite{covingtonletter} at low head gradients ($\sim 10^{-4}$ and $10{^-5}\ mm$). As these features coorespond to 
the location of ooids, they may be formed mechanically through abrasion focusing on the downstream end or chemomechanical
erosion where the ooid is entrained after the calcite matrix is dissolved. If these features are truly dissolutional, it 
may indicate that the ooid disrupts flow over the surface and thus alters the thickess of the DBL creating a down stepping 
pattern in the rock surface. The downstepping character is weakly visible in the scalloped sample from Sch\"{o}nberg-H\"{o}hlensystem, LPSC
(Figure \ref{fig:microscallops}). LPSC, as opposed to 71923A, has no allochems to disrupt flow. The patterns in LPSC are not arcute, like 
71923A, and are instead linear, yet the surface does still exhibit the "downstepping" pattern. Although puzzling, 
these arcute patterns are only present on one of the three scalloped samples and not on any other solutional feature.
These patterns will be discussed further in another section.
